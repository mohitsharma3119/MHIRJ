Note: This logic above is diferent from the DCU logic to post ""FDR FAIL"" (S) CAS msg:
DCU logic for ""FDR FAIL"" (S) CAS msg (IRORF):
FDR FAIL := [[L DCU Position * [[ ^FDR Valid + FDCU FAIL] * L Engine Running * R Engine Running]] * 1.0 Rising Edge] + (R DCU Position * XTALK FDR FAIL); 
Note: CAS msg logic above applies for DCU -107 & below. On DCU -108 & up, the ENG running is an OR logic, i.e. ENG1 or ENG2 running.

Conclusion, MDC msg can be logged in TAXI if both ENG running and beacon/strobe lights switch set to OFF. In these conditions the A/C is WonW, so the FDR is set to OFF causing ^FDR Valid and having both ENG running will trigger DCU L353b27 set thus MDC msg.
